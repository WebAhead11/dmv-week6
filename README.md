this is the sign up form that you have to fill up in order to create an account in our website which is mainly about you information
and we focused on the validation for example the email field must contain a '@' symbol, the user GOV-id must be from nine digits , the user full name must be from letters only and the mobile number must be from numbers only in order to submit the form and to create an account successfully
also the required fields has a "* symbol next to the field name so you can not submit the form without these information that you have to fill
